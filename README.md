# Adv
Adv is an object-oriented esolang.

The philosophy of adv is that everything which can be implemented within the langauge, should be implemented within the language.
Adv strives to have as minimal interpreter as possible, and have the standard(-like) libraries implement most of the language's features, without any hardcoded special cases.

Currently the only library for adv is Helpful Integrated Versatile library which is hosted inside this repo.
Note that even though this library implements things that'd typically be a part of a standard library, Helpful Integrated Versatile library is not a part of the adv standard, and it's just one of possible standard-like library implementations.
